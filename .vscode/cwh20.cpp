// object oriented programming :
// classes do not allocate any memory but objects and their data do.

// data abstraction - processing the function / programs without knowing the complex background processes.
// encapsulation - wrapping up of data and functions in a single unit.

// inheritance - using properties of another class into another.
// polymorphism - ability to take  more than one forms.

// dynamic binding - code which will execute is not known until the program runs .
// message passing - Object.message(information) call format.
